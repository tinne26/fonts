The Liberation font collection aims to be a metrically compatible, open alternative to Arial (sans-serif), Times New Roman (serif) and Courier New (monospace). The fact that they are one of the most commonly available and favored fonts in the Linux ecosystem is a testament to their quality. They are fairly neutral in character and work well as system and general purpose fonts. They are less geometrical than many newer fonts, but even if they don't look too "modern", they don't look dated at all either; they strike a great balance between classical inspiration and contemporary functional qualities.

Back in 2005, Ascender Corporation (later acquired by [Monotype Imaging](https://www.monotype.com/) in 2010) released Ascender Sans and Ascender Serif. Originally designed by Steve Matteson, these fonts would be [re-released in 2007](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/liberation-fonts) by Red Hat under their new "Liberation" trademark, an open license and a third monospace family added to the collection. Nowadays, development and maintenance continue at [liberationfonts](https://github.com/liberationfonts/liberation-fonts), a public Github repository.

Liberation fonts are licensed under the SIL Open Font License (see [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/tinne26/fonts/blob/main/liberation/LICENSE.txt) in this directory).
