The Liberation font collection aims to be a metrically compatible, open alternative to Arial (sans-serif), Times New Roman (serif) and Courier New (monospaced). The fact that they are one of the most commonly available and favored fonts in the Linux ecosystem is a testament to their quality. They are fairly neutral in character and feel right as system and general purpose fonts. They are less geometrical than other newer fonts, but while they don't look too "modern", they don't look dated at all either. They strike a great balance between classical inspiration and contemporary functional qualities.

Created as Ascender Sans and Ascender Serif, the Liberation font family was originally designed by Steve Matteson of Ascender Corporation in 2007. Development and maintenance are still alive at [liberationfonts](https://github.com/liberationfonts/liberation-fonts), a public Github repository.

Liberation fonts are licensed under the SIL Open Font License (see [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/tinne26/fonts/blob/main/liberation/LICENSE.txt) in this directory).
